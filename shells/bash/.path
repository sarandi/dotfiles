# This should be split into multiple files:
# 1. generic config with paths for default user stuff
# 2. specific config for this machine
# 3. applications -> their own files

# Path Conventions:

# - Set pass path initially so that subsequent additions are at the end of the
#   chain
# - Use $HOME instead of ~  UNTIL I can find why to do it the other way around ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
# - Other paths may exist outside of shells/bash/.path, but should be confined to
#   a file within apps/, by default apps/.apps
